# EASY-HOME-AUTOMATION
HOME AUTOMATION WITHOUT INTERNET 


Mechanism of removing as much human interaction as
technically possible and replacing them with
programmed electronic systems, essentially the automation
of home and housework.



Microcontroller ATMega328P is used for controlling the whole process.

We send some commands to the controlling system by using IR TV/DVD remote for
controlling AC home appliances.

After receiving a signal from IR remote, the microcontroller sends related signal to the 8V
relays which are responsible for switching ON or OFF of the home appliances through a
relay driver

For detecting IR remote signal, we use TSOP1738 IR Receiver.

We have used 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8 and 9 number buttons of IR TV remote, for controlling fan, light, etc.
respectively and it gets turned ON and so all the electrical appliances get turned ON when each
number button is pressed

If we want to turn OFF all the electrical appliances, we can press the power button and so all the
electrical appliances will get turned OFF.

So, it is easy to control the electrical appliances or AC loads through a single IR TV remote.
